# (WIP) Massively - Jekyll Theme

A Jekyll version of the "Prologue" theme by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).

# How to Use

Fork this repository and create a branch named `gh-pages`, then start editing the `_config.yml` file!

For those unfamiliar with how Jekyll works, check out [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/) for all the details.

All new sections should be added in the `_sections` folder in separate html documents. The following variables can be set with frontmatter:
- `Title` (required)
- `Icon` (required)
- `Order` (required; orders the sequence of sections on the page; if first, it will display with banner.jpg.)
- `Auto-header` (optional; "use-title" is default, "none" for no header, or custom header text)

To set the banner image, replace `images/banner.jpg` with another image with the same filename. Same for `avatar.jpg`.

# Jekyll and the single-page view

**This theme is designed to include all content on a single scrollable page.** That means that you don't need to use Jekyll's hardcoded support for `_pages` or `_posts`. Each section (intro, about me, etc.) is built from an html or Markdown document in the `_sections` folder with corresponding [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

Since Jekyll does not support multiple layout-formatted content sections per page, this theme doesn't have a `section.html` layout in the `_layouts` folder. Instead, look for `_layouts/home.html` and `_includes/section.html`.

There shouldn't be a need to set `permalink` in frontmatter because all content appears on the same page. In fact, to prevent visitors from requesting individual un-styled html files from `_sections` (i.e., by typing `/_sections/about-me.html` into the address bar), you can delete this directory from `_site` (**NOT** your project's root directory please!!) after building. All sections already exist in `_site/index.html`.

# Added Features

* **[Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) contact form integration** - just add your email to the `_config.yml` and it works!
* Add your **social profiles** easily in `_config.yml`. Only social profiles buttons you enter in `config.yml` show up on the site footer!
